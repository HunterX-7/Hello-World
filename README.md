# Hello-World
This repository contains a sample project that demonstrates how to connect a Ruby on Rails back-end with a React front-end.  The goal of this exercise is to apply previous knowledge of using gems with Rails to connect the back-end with the front-end, while also introducing new techniques for handling JavaScript assets in a Rails application.
